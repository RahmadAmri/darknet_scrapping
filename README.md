Hi. I can't make it back today at 12. Let's do it this way to save time. I want to give you a test task to try to complete. Here, I'll briefly explain what you need to do. You need to find a forum related to leaks. These forums are usually called Breach Forums. Users post various leaks there. Both black and white hat hackers upload data there. Essentially, I want you to find such forums. For example, create a list, register, and download files from there. Choose whatever you like, and give it to me as a test assignment. So, one file needs to be found on such a forum, of which there are quite a few on the internet. And the second file needs to be found on the Darknet. For the Darknet, use a VPN or the Tor browser, which allows you to access the Darknet. There are also various marketplaces and forums on the Darknet where you can obtain this data, including free ones. Therefore, the file also needs to be found on the Darknet, just like some leaks. This will serve as proof of completing the test assignment. Also, please provide links, screenshots, and sources from which you obtained and downloaded all of these. This way, we can essentially understand that you can handle this task. Then, perhaps, if all goes well, we can discuss the work, payment, deadlines, and tasks. Is this option suitable for you?
